Bedtime can be a challenging and frustrating daily experience for children and parents. To address this, we have developed an AI-powered webapp that generates tailored-made stories, that encourage a child through the bedtime transition in a smoothe, engaging and enjoyable way - for everyone!

Utilising artificial intelligence via the OpenAI API, the app will generate a unique story every night; capturing the child's imagination and incorporating their interests to maximise their enjoyment, while prompting children to perform the pre-selected bedtime steps via pop-ups throughout the story. These prompts are tailored to the story, and transform the routine into an exciting adventure, encouraging the child to complete their bedtime task, and ending with them tucked up in bed.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è
1. To run the flask app : 
-
To make sure that your environment is set up correctly for our app to run, please follow these instructions:

Make sure that you have got a virtual environment activated - I think that sometimes pycharm asks you if you want to activate an environment? If so, say yes.

Otherwise, to get into a virtual environment: in the terminal, make sure that you are in the project-for-CFG folder, and then type these commands (one at a time):

$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

_Please make sure you have installed all the necessary libraries - by running the following command_:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then to run the app, run the following command:
$ flask --app app run     

_OR_

- **flask --app app run --debug**

_OR_

- **flask run**

In the terminal, a link will then appear that looks like this :
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

2. Click that link, and our apps homepage will open in a new window in your browser!
